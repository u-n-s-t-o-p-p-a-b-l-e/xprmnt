Creating a high-performance Go application involves making efficient use of concurrency, minimizing memory usage, optimizing I/O operations, and leveraging Go's built-in capabilities. Here's an example of a high-performance TCP server that handles a large number of connections concurrently. This server echoes back any data it receives from the client.

High-Performance TCP Echo Server
This example demonstrates the use of Goroutines and an efficient connection handling strategy to create a high-performance TCP echo server.

Run the server:

```
go run main.go
```

Test the TCP echo server using a tool like 'telnet' or a custom client. Hereâ€™s a simple client for testing:

```
go run client.go
```

This example demonstrates a high-performance TCP echo server in Go, utilizing concurrency and efficient I/O handling to manage a large number of connections.
